# K-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm-using-AI

K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning. It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining.

## Working

KNN algorithm makes predictions by calculating similarity between the input sample and each training instance. This algorithm does not make strong assumptions about the form of mapping function hence it is Nonparametric. In simple words, by not making assumptions, the algorithm is free to learn any functional form from the training data.

## Which value is the nearest value i.e., which distance metrics can be used?

The most popular distance metrics used are :

* Euclidean Distance(most popular)
* Manhattan Distance
